## Visual Studio Code commands (not using Visual Studio)

- `dotnet new razor` (new razor project) / other commands `dotnet new webapp`
- `dotnet build` (to build it and make sure everything works, similar to normal C# class)
- `dotnet run` (to run it, similar to normal C# class) can also use `dotnet watch run` for hot updates
- - supposed to run on localhost:5001 sometimes it's very flighty and have to go to :5000 and then back to :5001 not sure what is going on with this.

## Experiments

- ExperimentOne is `dotnet new webapp` - visually looks very similar to experimenttwo
- ExperimentTwo is `dotnet new razor` - visually looks very similar to experimentone
- ExperimentThree is `dotnet new mvc` - controller part is similar to work, though it looks like it combines multiple pages in one controller and then there is an additional layer of controller code in the pages section instead of the controller., need to figure out where the work [Route("History")] coorelates in this.
- ExperimentFour is `dotnet new web`
